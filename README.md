# Bash scripts

Small set of bash scripts I use on my local machine.

* `pandoc`:    Shortcut for pandocing latex files to pdf
* `ccompile`:  Basic alias for C compiler
* `git-start`: So that I don't have to always type `git@github.com:`, and
               possibly my username, when cloning repos.
