# Bash scripts

Small set of bash scripts I use on my local machine (this directory is added
to my `$PATH`).

* `P`:         Shortcut for pandocing latex files to pdf
* `ccompile`:  Basic alias for C compiler
* `git-start`: So that I don't have to always type `git@github.com:`, and
               sometimes even my username, when cloning repos.
* `git-open`:  Opens the URL of a Git repo.
* `notifs`:    Enables or disables notification center on Mac
